# Debugging Hermes TUI Slash Commands

## Overview

Hermes slash commands span three layers — Python command registry, tui_gateway JSON-RPC bridge, and the Ink/TypeScript frontend. When a command misbehaves (missing from autocomplete, works in CLI but not TUI, config persists but UI doesn't update), the bug is almost always one layer being out of sync with another.

Use this skill when you encounter issues with slash commands in the Hermes TUI, particularly when commands aren't showing in autocomplete, aren't working properly in the TUI, or need to be added/updated.

## When to Use

- A slash command exists in one part of the codebase but doesn't work fully
- A command needs to be added to both backend and frontend
- Command autocomplete isn't working for specific commands
- Command behavior is inconsistent between CLI and TUI
- A command persists config but doesn't apply live in the TUI

## Architecture Overview

```
Python backend (hermes_cli/commands.py)     <- canonical COMMAND_REGISTRY
       │
       ▼
TUI gateway (tui_gateway/server.py)         <- slash.exec / command.dispatch
       │
       ▼
TUI frontend (ui-tui/src/app/slash/)        <- local handlers + fallthrough
```

Command definitions must be registered consistently across Python and TypeScript to work properly. The Python `COMMAND_REGISTRY` is the source of truth for: CLI dispatch, gateway help, Telegram BotCommand menu, Slack subcommand map, and autocomplete data shipped to Ink.

## Investigation Steps

1. **Check if the command exists in the TUI frontend:**
   ```bash
   search_files --pattern "/commandname" --file_glob "*.ts" --path ui-tui/
   search_files --pattern "/commandname" --file_glob "*.tsx" --path ui-tui/
   ```

2. **Examine the TUI command definition:**
   ```bash
   read_file ui-tui/src/app/slash/commands/core.ts
   # If not there:
   search_files --pattern "commandname" --path ui-tui/src/app/slash/commands --target files
   ```

3. **Check if the command exists in the Python backend
